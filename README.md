# C++ Project Hex (Board-game)
 
 All code written by David Sedarous / SekuOnline@github 
 
 Made to practice C++ OOP programming fundamentals by using them to implement game features.
 
 The goal is to make small commits frequently but intermittently between school-work in order to remain practiced.
