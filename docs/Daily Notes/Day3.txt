While implementing shuffle, I realized that using templates is
required to bypass writing the same code for different classes.

Templates:
    Allow for the type of an object to be passed as a parameter.
    In this case, this allows the shuffle() function to take any card type.
    Thus, it does not have to be written multiple times for ArmyCard and SpellCard.
    This will be useful for future methods and classes as well.

Need to look into Dynamic Memory Allocation for Cards, review those concepts.
