Tested deck functionality: Add card & shuffle.
Both functions work well, perhaps shuffle shoudln't allow for 
    a 'Card' pointer, as it can be misused if the wrong Card type is used
    for a deck.

I realized templates were unnecessary for allowing for 
    Spell-Cards and Army-Cards to be used for Deck methods:
    Since they're both sub-classes of 'Card', any function that
    takes a 'Card' parameter will allow either Spell-Cards
    or Army-Cards to be used.


I would like to implement a unit-testing framework before continuing:
    This will ensure that tests of the code will exist for checking
    at every phase of the project.

After this, the class structure can be expanded.
A 'board' should be put into place, that allows for 2 players.
Each player should have their own spell-deck and army-deck,
    as well as a 'hand' in which cares are stored when outside of the deck.

    This will also require either a 'discard' pile for cards,
    or some function to place cards at the bottom of the deck.


It is clear that the direct rules of the game will be required for 
    the project to continue.
