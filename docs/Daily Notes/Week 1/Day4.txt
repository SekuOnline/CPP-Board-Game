Implemented a cloning method for Army and Spell decks, primarily for testing.

Messed around with testing (Attempting to get Catch2 testing to work).

Spent a lot of time attempting to get the project to compile.
Need to look into makefiles for windows.
Previously, I worked with incredibly basic makefiles on a unix virtual machine
    for class.
Now that I am programming on windows and have a project structure,
    simple makefiles are not working for the purposes I need them to.
    They require paths from the project directory to each file,
    and at the moment place the object files into the project directory.
    Even after this, they still do not compile the project correctly.

Spent too much time on this today, will have to return to it another day (Tomorrow?)
