Review:
    Virtual Methods:
        Methods that are meant to be inherited, have no explicit implementation
        until they are overwritten by a child class.

    Inheritance:
        Creating a parent class with attributes and methods that are passed to their children.

    Doxygen:
        Commenting system (similar to JavaDocs)
        use by typing /** + 'Enter' 
        
Implementation:
    Set up a basic file structure

    Implemented a base 'Card' class to be inherited by any other card type
    Spell cards and Army cards are the two current card types.
        Both card types have their own subtypes, which are enums within their header file.

Immediate Plans:
    Create a 'Deck' parent class that is inherited by 'ArmyDeck' and 'SpellDeck' classes.
    Decks should hold an array of card pointers.
        Pointers are used, as the cards should not be deleted if removed from the deck.

    Create an UML Class diagram to represent the card structure.
