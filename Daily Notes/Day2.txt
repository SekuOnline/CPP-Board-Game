Review:
    const attribute: Read only, must be defined within the class, not constructor.

    const function: Must not modify anything within the class.

    Inheritance: Call the base classes' constructor within initialization, pass in any 
        inherited attributes.

Implementation:
    Set up basic deck class with an array of pointers to cards,
    will be inherited by ArmyDeck and SpellDeck classes.

    Moved enums to defs.h for simplicity, may move to their own header if defs becomes bloated
    to avoid slowing compile time.

Plans:
    Day 2 Goals (Monday):
        Headers for Decks, array of pointers to cards, ect.
        defs.h header for global variables

    Day 3 Goals (Tuesday):
        Implement basic functions for all card types (CPP files)
        Implement shuffling in Deck class
        Add good comments

    Day 4 Goals (Wednesday):
        Deconstructors (if simple)
        Unit testing (Test Shuffle function, any other function discussed)
        Road-mapping (Setting more goals and plans)
